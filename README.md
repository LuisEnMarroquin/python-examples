## Tuples

Are immutable lists, are not modifiable after their creation. They may or not have parenthesis

* Tuples are faster and take up less space than lists
* Can be used as keys in a dictionary (lists can't)
* If they allow to check if an element is in a tuple
* Adding, removing or moving elements is not allowed (append, extend, remove)
